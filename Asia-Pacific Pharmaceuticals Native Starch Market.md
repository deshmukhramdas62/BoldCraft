Its use in capsule formulations is largely attributed to its excellent properties of flowability and compressibility, making it ideal for filling formulations and ensuring consistent content distribution. Native starch also plays a key role in improving the dissolution properties of capsule contents, enhancing bioavailability and ensuring that active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are delivered effectively. The demand for capsules is growing steadily, particularly in markets such as Japan, where a shift towards capsule-based drug delivery systems is observed. With increasing preferences for easy-to-swallow oral dosage forms, native starch is likely to continue driving innovations in capsule technology, facilitating the delivery of both solid and semi-solid formulations. The shift towards more natural and biocompatible ingredients in pharmaceutical applications further supports the growth of native starch in the capsule market. </p><h2>Tablets</h2><p>Native starch plays a pivotal role in the formulation of tablets within the Asia–Pacific pharmaceuticals market. As one of the most widely used excipients, starch is incorporated into tablet formulations primarily as a binder, disintegrant, and filler. Its ability to enhance the mechanical strength and friability of tablets is crucial, ensuring that the final product is stable and performs optimally during handling and consumption. The demand for tablets as a preferred drug delivery form is increasing, particularly as the population in Asia–Pacific regions experiences demographic shifts, with a growing elderly population requiring chronic disease management. Tablets offer ease of administration, cost-effectiveness, and high patient compliance, making them an attractive option for both generic and branded drug manufacturers. With the surge in healthcare infrastructure development and increasing awareness about the benefits of oral dosage forms, native starch remains an essential component in tablet formulations, contributing to the continued growth of the pharmaceutical sector in the region. </p><p>In addition to its technical properties, native starch is favored for its natural origin and compatibility with various pharmaceutical ingredients. This aligns with the growing trend of preferring sustainable and biocompatible excipients in pharmaceutical formulations. With the Asia–Pacific market’s increasing regulatory requirements for the safety and environmental impact of excipients, native starch presents an ideal solution, being both biodegradable and derived from renewable resources. The integration of native starch into tablet formulations has thus become essential not only from a functional perspective but also in response to consumer and regulatory demands for more natural, eco-friendly, and sustainable pharmaceutical solutions. </p><h2>Capsules</h2><p>Native starch is also widely used in the formulation of capsules, particularly as a filler and disintegrant. Its versatility and effectiveness in encapsulating active pharmaceutical ingredients make it an essential excipient in the production of hard and soft gelatin capsules. The global preference for capsule-based drug delivery forms is expanding due to the ease of swallowing and the ability to mask the taste of active ingredients, which is particularly important for pediatric and geriatric populations. In Asia–Pacific markets, capsule formulations are gaining popularity in over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceutical products due to their advantages in improving patient compliance. Native starch plays a critical role in optimizing the stability and consistency of the encapsulated product, ensuring that the active ingredients are protected during the manufacturing process and throughout the shelf life of the product. </p><p>The growth of the capsule segment in the Asia–Pacific pharmaceutical market is also driven by innovations in capsule technology, with native starch contributing to the development of specialized formulations. For instance, starch-based capsules are being used to create controlled-release and sustained-release formulations, improving the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. As the region continues to experience an increase in demand for high-quality, effective, and patient-friendly drug delivery systems, native starch’s application in capsules is expected to expand, driven by its functional benefits and growing demand for oral dosage forms. The trend towards natural and biodegradable excipients further strengthens the adoption of native starch in capsule formulations, reinforcing its position as a key ingredient in the Asia–Pacific pharmaceutical market. </p><h2>Granular Formulation</h2><p>Granular formulations are another significant application of native starch in the Asia–Pacific pharmaceutical industry. Native starch is used to create granules that can be compressed into tablets or filled into capsules, offering versatility in pharmaceutical formulations. The use of native starch in granular formulations provides excellent flow properties, which are essential for ensuring uniform distribution of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and excipients during the manufacturing process. Additionally, starch granules can help in the controlled release of active ingredients, offering sustained or delayed release properties that are becoming increasingly popular in the region’s pharmaceutical market. This feature of native starch is particularly important for drugs that require specific release profiles, such as in the treatment of chronic conditions. As the demand for personalized medicine and more tailored drug delivery systems grows, granular formulations incorporating native starch are expected to become more prevalent. </p><p>The growing emphasis on patient-centric drug formulations is also contributing to the increased use of granular formulations in Asia–Pacific markets. Granules offer enhanced stability and improve the overall manufacturing process, reducing the risk of product defects and ensuring high-quality output. Furthermore, native starch in granular form provides a cost-effective solution for pharmaceutical manufacturers, as it is easily sourced, requires minimal processing, and is compatible with a wide range of APIs. As the pharmaceutical industry in Asia–Pacific continues to evolve, the role of native starch in granular formulations will expand, driven by its functional benefits and the need for efficient and patient-friendly drug delivery solutions. </p><h2>Other Applications</h2><p>In addition to its applications in tablets, capsules, and granular formulations, native starch is also employed in a variety of other pharmaceutical applications. These include its use as a thickening agent, binder, stabilizer, and disintegrant in liquid formulations and topical products. In the growing market for topical drugs and dermatological products, native starch provides essential functional benefits by ensuring the stability, texture, and spreadability of formulations.
